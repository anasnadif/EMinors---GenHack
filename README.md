Agriculture's exposure to climate impacts is not new, and farmers are the first witnesses and victims of these impacts. Increasingly early, intense and frequent heatwaves, changes in rainfall patterns and late frosts are having an increasingly harsh effect on agricultural production.
Given the importance of this sector, there is an urgent need to define resilient solutions for the future climate and develop new tool.
Changes in the climate can be seen in episodes of heavy rainfall, drought, and temperatures which can undermine food security by slowing down growth on a global scale. This drought is specifically affecting many crops, particularly maize. Maize is the world's most important cereal crop, making it an essential resource for millions of people.

**The purpose of this challenge is to build a spatial generator of annual maize yield.**

This repository hosts the code developed for the Genhack3 competition, aimed at simulating the maize yield across different years in the context of climate change. Our project seeks to address the urgent need for resilient agricultural practices by developing a tool that predicts annual maize yields under varying climate conditions.
